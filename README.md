# InlineDes

Server side of Inline Description project::

When we usually visit any site will have a overview of info on hub page.

To see detail we need to navigate to new page after clicking on overview.

Mostly it should be on same page for users ease.

We have Mongo database used for this with two collections (tiledatas-> have reference id for respective entry in description collection).

This Project help to do so.
